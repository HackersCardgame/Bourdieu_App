### Named Entity Realtionship Model + App of Pierre Bourdieus Theory (2022: early pre-alpha stage)


I suffer from schizophrenia since 20 years. The treatment of schizophrenic people from Mental Institution Königsfelden Kanton Aargau mainly consists out of drugging people -- even without consent -- without talking about the situation that caused the current psychosis like eg. "Open Dialog" [1] does.


so the idea is to write some sort of Application with an easy to use user-interface to apply the concepts of pierre bourdieu's theory to patients that would like to participate.


the website shall consist of a backend [for the momenet i think this will be LAMP] and a nice GUI [for the moment i think this will be a fancy javascript app]


I would like to point here to the bachelor thesis of Aida Dizdar [2] because she already describes roughly what such a software should do and thanks to her bachelor thesis I had the idea of writing such a software.


that is presumably the task of sociology.

The problem of sociology, which tries to reproduce behaviour in groups or better to predict them, problem of such things is that if one uses to much parameters the Entity Relationship Model becomes to big and complicated where it ends in denial of service or spam oneself with to much parameters.


In my opinion, Bourdieu's concept is complex enough to also give the 1% of schizophrenic people a place / illusio to life but does not have the problem of being to bloated.

### Manual to me, myself end my teddy bear

i have good and bad times:
* if I talk to my teddy bear:
    * just let me talk to my teddy

* if I annoy you with tons of emails:
    * unsolved busines that needs to be mitigated, otherwise i decompensate
    * maybe having a fair conversation with me would be helpful, maybe for both

* if you see me in a shop and i act like i stole something
    * i don't steal, you confuse paranoja with guilt

* if i ignore you (i guess that never hapened, normally i'm the ignored one)
    * maybe you ended up in the spam folder or you hurt me so much that i must protect myself

* if i hit my head against the wall or cut myself (self-harm) 
    * someone really hurt me, existencial crisis
    * in such situations only people i really trust can help me

each special interest (no matter if autistic or schizophrenic) needs his/her own person that selects the relevant topics to fill out the matching table
eg. Computer Science: Rust, Algorithms, C, Chess, 3D ...
eg. Religion: there i can not do the lists, maybe main religion, Noahidism, catholic chronicles ...

Whitgenstein would call it "Sprachspiele" but with symbols and content. Each kid needs someone to play with, otherwise it's likely that it gets more paranoid, that it more ran a way noone else can bring him/her back from, because they dont know the sources and the logic behind

finding other peoples that have similar interests would possibly stabilize and give the person at least some people to talk about
* tought required is "Rückzugsmöglichkeit"
* required is some personnel that acts when things go completely wrong
* required would be that normal society accepts that this sort of people is different, no matter if autistic or schizophrenic

for my case, i talk often about cyberwar or electronical psychological warfare, if you are completely isolatet because even your parents dont want to talk with you psyche suffers from the lonelyness, and that is some sort of psychological warfare.

we need also a tutorial or best practices how to treat a person with schizophrenia or autism, it is widely accepted, that this sort of people is more vulnerable, so it would be benefical for all to respact that like we respect special threatment of people in wheel chairs
* don't isolate completely
* try to understand his/her point of view, he or she invests a lot of time for their content, just saying "thats crazy" is an insult and isolates this person more
* don't be partner of him or her without taking care of him/her, because relaizing that there is a lucky life with another person and then one throws away the patient makes the situation for the patient much much more worse and worst case resulting 1000s of suicide attempts because of the separation, and above, isolates him/here more
* normally noone would like to take responsability for such a patient like autistic people are often left alone with their worldview by the age of 10, someone should take responsibility, i try to take responsibility, and it would be nice to have some sort of a class room or other places where the patients can meet and greet and organize self-help for them and others
* keep in mind, that in a city with 20'000 people and 1% has autism or schizophrenia that then you have only 200 other mates with the same desease, and maybe the would like to play with same-age people, so it would be reduced to potentially only 20 people with the same desease, but maybe not with the same interest
* lack of contacts and interaction they will end up in conspiracy theories and even promote theories that sound plausible to them
