### Named Entity Realtionship Model + App of Pierre Bourdieus Theory (2022: early pre-alpha stage)


I suffer from schizophrenia since 20 years. The treatment of schizophrenic people from Mental Institution Königsfelden Kanton Aargau mainly consists out of drugging people -- even without consent -- without talking about the situation that caused the current psychosis like eg. "Open Dialog" [1] does.


so the idea is to write some sort of Application with an easy to use user-interface to apply the concepts of pierre bourdieu's theory to patients that would like to participate.


the website shall consist of a backend [for the momenet i think this will be LAMP] and a nice GUI [for the moment i think this will be a fancy javascript app]


I would like to point here to the bachelor thesis of Aida Dizdar [2] because she already describes roughly what such a software should do and thanks to her bachelor thesis I had the idea of writing such a software.


that is presumably the task of sociology.

The problem of sociology, which tries to reproduce behaviour in groups or better to predict them, problem of such things is that if one uses to much parameters the Entity Relationship Model becomes to big and complicated where it ends in denial of service or spam oneself with to much parameters.


In my opinion, Bourdieu's concept is complex enough to also give the 1% of schizophrenic people a place / illusio to life but does not have the problem of being to bloated.

### Manual to me, myself end my teddy bear

i have good and bad times:
* if I talk to my teddy bear:
    * just let me talk to my teddy

* if I annoy you with tons of emails:
    * unsolved busines that needs to be mitigated, otherwise i decompensate
    * maybe having a fair conversation with me would be helpful, maybe for both

* if you see me in a shop and i act like i stole something
    * i don't steal, you confuse paranoja with guilt

* if i ignore you (i guess that never hapened, normally i'm the ignored one)
    * maybe you ended up in the spam folder or you hurt me so much that i must protect myself

* if i hit my head against the wall or cut myself (self-harm) 
    * someone really hurt me, existencial crisis
    * in such situations only people i really trust can help me

each special interest (no matter if autistic or schizophrenic) needs his/her own person that selects the relevant topics to fill out the matching table
eg. Computer Science: Rust, Algorithms, C, Chess, 3D ...
eg. Religion: there i can not do the lists, maybe main religion, Noahidism, catholic chronicles ...

Whitgenstein would call it "Sprachspiele" but with symbols and content. Each kid needs someone to play with, otherwise it's likely that it gets more paranoid, that it more ran a way noone else can bring him/her back from, because they dont know the sources and the logic behind

finding other peoples that have similar interests would possibly stabilize and give the person at least some people to talk about
* tought required is "Rückzugsmöglichkeit"
* required is some personnel that acts when things go completely wrong
* required would be that normal society accepts that this sort of people is different, no matter if autistic or schizophrenic
