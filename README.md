# Bourdieu_App
### Named Entity Ship model + App of Pierre Bourdieus Theory (early alpha stage)

I suffer from schizophrenia since 20 years. The treatment of schizophrenic people from Mental Institution KÃ¶nigsfelden Kanton Aargau mainly consists out of drugging people -- even without consent -- without talking about the situation that caused the current psychosis like eg. "Open Dialog" [1] does.

so the idea is to write some sort of Application with an easy to use user-interface to apply the concepts of pierre bourdieu's theory to patients that would like to participate.

the website shall consist of a backend [for the momenet i think this will be LAMP] and a nice GUI [for the moment i think this will be a fancy javascript app]

I would like to quote the the bachelor thesis of Aida Dizdar [2] because she already describes roughly what such a software should do.
